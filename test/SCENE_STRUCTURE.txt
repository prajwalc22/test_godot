Key Features:
-------------
- Player (Spirit) uses arrow keys/WASD for movement
- Black Cat follows the player when distance > 2 units
- Camera follows the player from a third-person perspective
- Ground plane provides collision surface
- Forest placeholders create an eerie environment layout
- All shapes are placeholders ready for asset replacement
